**Command, Conquer, Build, Survive!**

In the aftermath of the Great Division, scattered settlements fight for survival across a fractured landscape. As a newly appointed commander, you've been entrusted with humanity's last hope: a single outpost with dwindling resources and brave volunteers ready to rebuild civilization. Gather precious materials, construct vital facilities, and navigate treacherous terrain while rival factions emerge from the shadows. Your decisions will determine whether your people thrive or perish in this unforgiving new world.
